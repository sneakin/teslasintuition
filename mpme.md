Abstract
===

The ratio between the mass of a photon to that of an electron is derived from the geometry of quantum space-time.

Introduction
===

There have been any attempts at calculating the rtio between a proton and an electron. [citation]
While it is easy to accept the value of the ratio, 1836, [citation] as a given, light would be shed on the Universe if this value can be derived from first principles.
Using the map provided by quantum space-time, this article will demonstrate that the Mp/Me ratio is encoded in the geometry of quantum space-time.

Quantum Space-time
===

Quantum space-time as described by Thad Roberts theorizes that spacetime itself is a superfluid made from elemental quantums. [citation]
These quantums would be exactly like voxels, but QST places these in a three dimensional superspace where their superfluid motions can take place.
What results is a fuzzy picture, where the "voxels" move and jitter, at the lowest level to any observer that spans many of these "voxels".

QST defines light as a wave through the vacuum superfluid.
This means at the smallest level light is one quanta colliding with another quanta.
These back and forth collisions set the speed of light.

As with any wave in any medium, the density of the quantums will cause light to have a curved path while traveling through different densities.
Since light curves around masses per General Relativity, space is thus more dense around more massive objects.

The more massive proton is surrounded by more space than an electron.
The amount of space should be proportional to their masses.
Therefore: Qp/Qe = Mp/Me


Our Particles
===

Let's step back into the real world.
The fundamental particles we see, for the most part, are electrons zipping around protons and neutrons.
From every day experience we know things have what we call mass.
The more massive an object is, the more effort it takes to get it moving or to stop--to accelerate.

We can assume from everything consisting of our fundamental particles that the fundamental particles have mass too.
What we find is that the proton is 1836 [cite] times more massive than the electron.
It was also found that protons are made of three components--the quarks.
Despite our best efforts we still haven't cracked an electron.


Qp/Qe = Mp/Me


Motion
===


Q*6/2 * 3^(T-1)

Results
===

| # of quanta | 1/2 # osciltations | # sides | Result | Result/Result e- |
| 1 | 1/2 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 162 | 648 | 216 |
| 3 | (2 + 3)/2 | 729 | 5467.5 | 1822 |
